Description: An R interface to C++ code that runs MCMC to infer the ClonalOrigin model, for inferring homologous recombination in bacteria. This package allows the use of Reversible multiple-Jump MCMC, as detailed in the paper "Speeding up Inference of Homologous Recombination in Bacteria" by Medina-Aguayo et al. (2023), Bayesian Analysis.
